# pythonscripts

nevermind this is where i'm putting my python scripts now

assLengthScript.py: a python script that takes any number of arguments (which are fasta files) and outputs a .txt file that lists the length of the assemblies 
unzipurpython.py: a python script that moves zipfiles into a directory that shares the name with them and unzips them
